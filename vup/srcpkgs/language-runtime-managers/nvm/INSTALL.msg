To use nvm, you must source the correct script for your shell.

For Bash/Zsh, add the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc:

    source /etc/profile.d/nvm.sh

Or to use it in the current session:

    source /etc/profile.d/nvm.sh

Note: nvm is not compatible with the Fish shell. Fish users should look into 'nvm.fish' or use nvm inside a bash session.
